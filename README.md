Dukkantek.Inventory

1.  This is working solution, If something is not working for you then let me know I can show you the demo on my local system.
2.  You can recover the database from migrations.
3.  You can create categories first to insert products related to that categories.
4.  Once you have prodcuts you get count or status of products.
5.  You can also change the status of the products.
6.  Also Xunit Test project is added for test cases.

Let me know if you face any issue. Thanks
